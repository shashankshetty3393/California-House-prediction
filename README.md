•	Analyzed a housing dataset (20,640 rows, 10 variables) to predict median_house_value and generate actionable insights for real estate pricing strategy. 
•	Conducted exploratory data analysis, handled missing values with median imputation, applied log transformation to skewed variables, label-encoded categorical features, and standardized data using StandardScaler. 
 
•	Utilized Python libraries including Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, and Matplotlib for data manipulation, statistical analysis, and model training. 
•	Built and compared Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, and Gradient Boosting Regressor models; optimized performance using GridSearchCV with hyperparameters such as n_estimators, max_depth, and min_samples_split. 
•	Achieved best results with Random Forest Regressor (RMSE: 48,388.27; MAE: 31,082.76), improving model accuracy and supporting data-driven investment decisions. 
•	Uncovered key business insights, including the impact of income level, housing density, and proximity to the ocean on property prices, and made strategic recommendations for pricing and development. 
•	Created an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize trends by location, income, and ocean proximity, enabling stakeholders to monitor market shifts and drive decisions in real-time.
